# Review for Quiz 1

## Overview

The quiz will be four or five short answer questions.

I'll mark each question on a four-level scale:

- ***0*** (ungradeable): ungradeable, no answer, too incomplete.

- ***1*** (needs improvement): shows effort, but has too many issues to be considered satisfactory.

- ***2*** (satisfactory): substantially complete and correct with only minor issues, if any.

- ***3*** (exceeds satisfactory): demonstrates insight and clarity beyond a satisfactory answer (not common).
 
If you get an *S* or *E* grade on most of the questions, you'll get satisfactory credit for the quiz. If everyone in your team passes the quiz, then you will receive a **bonus point**, which counts toward increasing your final grade.
