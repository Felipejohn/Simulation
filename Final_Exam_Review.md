# Final Exam Review

## Directions

The following questions are the material for the final exam. I will choose approximately twelve of them as the content for the exam.

The questions on the exam will appear exactly as they do in this document. There will be no questions that are not in this review.

No notes, books, or other aids are allowed during the exam. I will give you a formula sheet with the following:

- Bayes' Rule
- M/G/1 queue length equation
- Little's Law and the Utilization Law
- PMFs of the binomial and geometric distributions
- PDF and CDF of the exponential distribution

## Discrete Probability Distributions

### Binomial vs. Geometric
Describe a situation that would be best modeled with a binomial distribution and a situation that would be best modeled with a geometric
distribution.

### Jolly Roving Tar
Daniel Myers has received an acceptance letter from Rollins College and he wants to reason about the probability that he will become
Tommy the Tar.
	
Becoming Tommy the Tar is extremely rare: only .0001% of the United States population has been Tommy the Tar. 

While Rollins College is very quick to send out acceptance letters, the United States 
Postal Service is not a very reliable way of sending out letters in this modern age. The 
probability of a true Tommy the Tar replacement receiving an acceptance letter is 2%, 
but the probability of a random United States citizen receiving the acceptance letter is 
37%.

Given that he received a Rollins College acceptance letter, what is the probability that Daniel Myers will be the new Tommy the Tar?

Hint:

P(Letter) = .37

### 

In ancient China, the emperor would select a random ball out of a magical urn, every time picked out a ball, 2 random balls disappear and 3 new ones appear.

The Urn contains 10 Red balls and 13 black balls when he begins, If he attacks after every red ball and hold back after every black ball.
What is the probability that after three picks, he attacked every time?
