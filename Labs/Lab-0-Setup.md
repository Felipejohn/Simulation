# Setup

This lab will help you setup codeanywhere, our online development environment. You'll get to review some basic Linux terminal commands
and practice cloning and pushing with GitHub.

## codeanywhere

Many of you used the Cloud 9 online development environment in previous classes. Since being purchased by Amazon, they've totally changed
how their system works, to the point that it's no longer appropriate for us to use in classes.

Dr. Summet and I have decided to switch over to an alternate web environment: codeanywhere. It's very similar to Cloud 9, in that it
gives you both an IDE and a Linux terminal in the browser. It's slightly different, however, in that you only have one workspace in
codeanywhere. In Cloud 9, we typically made a new workspace for each course; now, you'll have one private workspace with subdirectories
for each course you're taking.

### Creation

**If you've already created your account and workspace you can skip this section**.

If you haven't done so, create an account at `https://codeanywhere.com/`. You only need one account, so don't make another one if you
already created one for another class. You'll need to put in a valid e-mail to approve your account, but you won't need to pay or input a
credit card number.

Once you are signed in for the first time, you'll want to create your workspace. Make the workspace name

```
YOURNAME
```

where `YOURNAME` is your Rollins e-mail id. For example, mine would be `dmyers`.

When you open the workspace for the first time, you'll see a panel that says "Connection Wizard" at the top. This will allow you to choose
the virtual machine stack and default environment for your workspace. This is not as important as it sounds, because you can always
install new tools later through the terminal.

Put your Rollins id name in the `Name` field of the Connection Wizard.

Scroll down and select the **Python3** stack on the **Ubuntu 14.04** OS. **Double-check that you've chosen the stack with the Ubuntu OS**.

Don't check the "Enable Always On" box: you don't have that feature on the free plan. Click the "Create" button to build the workspace.
After a minute or so you will see the editor window appear with a tab giving information on the workspace and a tab with a Linux terminal.

### Sharing Time

Click on the icon in the top bar that looks like a paper airplane. Enter my e-mail, `dmyers@rollins.edu`, and keep the "Can Edit" option
selected. Click "Done" to share your workspace with me. Note that your workspace is private by default: other students can't access it.
