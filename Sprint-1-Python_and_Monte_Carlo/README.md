# Sprint 1: Python and Monte Carlo Simulation

## Overview

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this sprint, you will be able to

- Write small to moderately-sized programs in Python using standard programming features: variables, conditionals, loops, etc.

- Use a Python development environment.

- Design and implement a simulation that uses randomness to estimate the outcome of a complex calculation or process.

- Be familiar with Python's `random` library and the use of a uniform random variable for making choices in programs.
